          If you have a pension frozen within a UK pension scheme and you live
          or plan to live outside the UK you may want to explore transferring
          your funds into a Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) or Qualifying
          Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme (QROPS).
          <br />
          <br />
          Choosing the right retirement vehicle is something we can help you
          with. Talking to one of our experienced overseas financial advisors is
          easy and we will take time to understand your personal circumstances
          before advising you on your choices and their respective benefits.
          <br />
          <br />

          circumstances and retirement goals we will manage the transfer for
          you.

        <h5 className="text">What Is A SIPP?</h5>
        <p className="text">
          A SIPP is essentially a DIY pension. You are in control of what you
          invest and where you invest, with a small number of limitations. A
          SIPP is very flexible but this of course comes with responsibility.
          <br />
          <br />
          Because you are in control you either need to become very aware of
          what are wise investment choices or you need to build a good
          relationship with someone who can provide you with objective advice on
          what are good investments for you, relative to your retirement plan.
          <br />
          <br />
          Investments that can be held in a SIPP include:
        </p>

        <ul className="text key-features">
          <li>Global Investment Fund Accounts</li>
          <li>Fixed Income Portfolio Accounts</li>
          <li>Principle Protection Accounts</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text">
          When you live or work outside of the UK you have choices. A SIPP is a
          choice but to make sure you know what’s right for you we recommend you
          talk to one of our advisors.

        <h5 className="text">Talk To An OIB Advisor</h5>
        <p className="text">
          Our advisors are easy to reach and will take time to understand your
          existing retirement plans before recommending the right solution for
          you. If you haven’t reviewed your retirement plan for some time now is
          a great opportunity to do so. We’re here to help.

        <h5 className="text">What Is A QROPS?</h5>
        <p className="text">
          A QROPS is an offshore retirement scheme, recognised by HMRC (HM
          Revenue and Customs) as meeting standards and conditions equivalent to
          a UK pension. This approval allows anyone with a UK registered pension
          who is living outside the UK, or is intending to leave the UK, to
          transfer his or her pension offshore.
          <br />
          <br />
          A QROPS remains under UK pension rules up to the point you have been
          non-resident for 5 tax years. After this a QROPS gains increased
          flexibility.
          <br />
          <br />
          The key benefits of a QROPS are:
        </p>

        <ul className="text key-features">
          <li>Tax Efficiency</li>
          <li>Single versus Multiple Pensions</li>
          <li>Investment Choices</li>
          <li>Investment Flexibility</li>
          <li>No Inheritance Tax</li>
          <li>Simplified Estate Planning</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text">
          Many types of UK pensions can be transferred to a QROPS, but not all.
          We can tell you if your existing pension plan(s) can be transferred
          and most importantly if your circumstances allow you to transfer.
