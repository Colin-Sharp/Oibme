          Gold hit its performance peak back in the heady days of 2011. Trading
          then at $1,900 per ounce, Gold was unstoppable. It was running the
          race of its life, as investors, thrilled by its run, roared it on like
          bulls from the sidelines.
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          Gold is a safe haven, somewhere to run to when the going gets tough.
          And wow did it get tough.
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          In 2008 when the world’s economy tanked, Gold became the ‘golden boy’
          of the marketplace. Investors couldn’t get enough of it. Whilst we
          know of the spiritual association with gold in India, for the rest of
          the world, when the price of gold soared to heavenly heights, this
          precious metal was elevated to near Godly status.
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          Gold is bought and sold as a commodity. Jewelry is the obvious one
          here and electronics, with face creams and dentistry (think gansta’
          rapper) less obvious examples to some. It’s use as a store of value
          and an insurance policy against economic and geopolitical upheaval is
          evident from the vast reserves of bullion stored by central banks
          across the world. Gold has a tendency to hold its value, to maintain
          its purchasing power, it’s often quoted that “with an ounce of gold a
          man could buy a fine suit of clothes in the time of Shakespeare, in
          that of Beethoven and Jefferson, in the Depression of the 1930’s”
          which clearly explains why it’s used so effectively to preserve
          wealth, particularly over long periods of time.
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          The price of gold started its steep descent when signs of an economic
          recovery after the shock of 2008 became apparent. When the dollar
          strengthened, with it came the prospect of increased interest rates.
          Why hold Gold when unlike other assets it brings no income? It’s
          outrageously expensive to store not to mind insure! Why not invest
          that money elsewhere and watch it make a return? So they did,
          Investors looked elsewhere and slowly but surely this precious shiny
          metal lost its sheen.
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          Gold it appears, doesn’t like good news. When a deal was reached with
          Greece thoughts of a failing Euro and the crisis that would come with
          it became the stuff of nightmares rather than a looming reality; Gold
          would likely have thrived on the chaos. When heightened tensions with
          Iran were eased after a nuclear deal was signed, war was no longer on
          the table; Gold always rallies when there’s a war on. A case in point
          is the Immediate aftermath of the September 11th attacks on the world
          trade Centre in New York when prices soared as investors dumped
          riskier assets and turned their attentions towards safe havens, ie
          Gold.
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          And then, of course there’s China. The great Eastern powerhouse was
          supposed to come to the Gold Reserve party, but it didn’t even bother
          to get dressed, never mind turn up. Hopes were pinned on China
          massively increasing their Gold reserves, but much to the chagrin of
          the Gold Bugs, that just didn’t happen and Gold languished at record
          lows.
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          But all good things come to those who wait. And then yesterday
          happened. Gold has been rising in 2016 amid concerns that the world
          economy is facing stormy conditions once more. Weaker US growth will
          delay interest rate hikes which is great news for this non yielding
          asset. Yesterday in response to heavy losses to the share price of
          major banking corporations, indicating growing fears about the banking
          sector – Gold rallied. We saw it nearly hit the psychological barrier
          of $1,200 per ounce with some analysts predicting that the tide is
          turning and Gold is set to climb even higher this year….
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          It looks like Gold has a sinister side. It thrives on turmoil. And if
          the turmoil persists, Gold will be back to doing what it does best.
          Glittering.
