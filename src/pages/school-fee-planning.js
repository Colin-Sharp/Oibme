        A good education is an investment for the future, the return of which is
        almost impossible to estimate. However the cost of private and
        university education is continually rising. For secondary education at
        most international schools today, you can expect to pay around £12,000
        per child per year.
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to help you meet these costs, OIB and our network of
        professional independent financial advisors are able to offer truly
        flexible investment accounts that allow you to take regular withdrawals
        on a termly (to coincide with university or school terms), quarterly,
        annually or as one off withdrawals.

      <h4 className="text">School Fees</h4>
      <p className="text">
        Most expatriates will consider sending their children to private or
        international schools. However, new figures show that the total cost of
        such an education for children starting school at five and finishing at
        18 is now in excess of £200,000.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text">University Costs</h4>
      <p className="text">
        More and more children are now going to university. This means the state
        is less and less able to provide for them without significant help from
        parents. In the UK grants no longer exist, fees have sky-rocketed, and
        loans can turn into huge debts.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Push University Guide predicts that average debts may reach £53,000
        for UK students starting in 2015, double the figure for 2011. The same
        survey says average annual debt rose 6.4% in the past year: faster than
        inflation. Education inflation is also running at an average of 7.5%
        p.a.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even if fees are capped, there’s the rising cost of their accommodation,
        computers, transport, and food to consider. If your children are young
        now, those costs could rise to over £100,000 for three years of UK
        university education in the not too distant future. It’s best to be
        prepared.
