        Financial Consultant with 26 yearsâ€™ experience in financial planning in

        <br />
        <br />
        After having worked for 10 years with Old Mutual South Africa, I then
        branched out into Banking and Corporate Financial planning both in South
        Africa and Internationally.
        <br />
        <br />
        The past 7 years I have been a financial planner servicing the needs of
        expatriates in Muscat the capital of the Sultanate of Oman with Offshore
        investment Brokers International.

        My background is in all forms of financial planning from retirement
        planning to Estate planning and Trusts, from education planning to risk
        insurance.
        <br />
        <br />
        My speciality is in Risk and Business assurance where the continuity of
        business and family financial interests become paramount.
        <br />
        <br />I have recently moved to Rabat the capital of Morocco where I am
        busy opening a new office in Financial planning under Offshore

        the international community of Morocco.
