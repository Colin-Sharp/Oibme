          A Thorough Financial Review Is Simply Invaluable
        </h3>
        <p className="text">
          Most people assume if they have no money then they don’t need a
          financial review but these are the people who need the review the most
          – people with this frame of mind will go through life just getting buy
          or scraping the bottom of the barrel, so to speak.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ask yourself…
        </p>
        <ul className="text key-features">
          <li>What if I lost my job?</li>
          <li>What if I became ill?</li>
          <li>What if I had children?</li>
          <li>What if I lost my partner?</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text">
          Wouldn’t it be great if you had enough security and protection in
          place that if any of those things happen your life could continue as
          financially normal as it was? This is where a financial review comes
          in… your adviser will sit down and show you what’s possible – you can
          then set goals that will protect you financially for your future.
